1) what is classes?

=> A class in JavaScript is a syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. 
   It allows you to define constructor functions, properties, and methods in a structured and readable way.



** Key Features of JavaScript Classes **

Use the class keyword.
Have a special method called constructor() for initializing new objects.
Support methods, getters, setters, and inheritance via the extends keyword.
Methods inside a class are automatically added to the classâ€™s prototype.


2) what is a constructor?

=> A constructor is a special function used to create and initialize objects in JavaScript. It is invoked using the new keyword
   and sets up properties and methods for the new object using the this keyword.

* It is called using the new keyword.
* The this keyword inside a constructor refers to the new object being created.


3) what is this keyword?
=> The this keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the function. Its value depends on the context in which the 
   function is called

4) what is supar keyword?
=> The super keyword in JavaScript is used to access and call functions on an object's parent, typically within class inheritance. 
   It allows a subclass to refer to and invoke methods or constructors from its parent class.

5) what is a extends keyword?
=> The extends keyword is used in JavaScript to create a class that is a child of another class. It allows the subclass to inherit 
   properties and methods from the parent class.

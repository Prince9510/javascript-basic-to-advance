Loops in javascript

1) for loop:
   => A loop that repeats a block of code a specific number of times.
   => Syntax: 
   
   for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
      // code  
   }

2) while loop:
   => A loop that executes as long as the specified condition is true.
   => Syntax: 
   
   while (condition) { 
        // code 
    }

3) do...while loop:
   => A loop that executes the block of code at least once, then repeats as long as the condition is true.
   => Syntax: 
   do { 
        // code 
      } while (condition)

4) for...in loop:
   => A loop that iterates over the enumerable properties of an object.
   => Syntax: 
   for (variable in object) { 
     // code 
    }

5) for...of loop:
   => A loop that iterates over the values of an iterable object (e.g., arrays, strings).

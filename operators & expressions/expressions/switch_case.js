Imagine you're building a program that categorizes products in an e-commerce store into different types of shipping categories 
based on their weight. You need to use a switch statement to determine the shipping cost based on the following rules:


Products weighing less than or equal to 1kg: "Standard Shipping" at a cost of $5.
Products weighing between 1kg and 5kg (exclusive): "Priority Shipping" at a cost of $15.
Products weighing between 5kg and 10kg (exclusive): "Express Shipping" at a cost of $25.
Products weighing over 10kg: "Heavy Freight" at a cost of $50.
You are also given a product weight as input. How would you structure a switch statement to categorize the product into the correct shipping type and assign the proper shipping cost

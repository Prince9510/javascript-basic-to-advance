1) in script some time use the 'var' keyword instead of 'let' and 'const' for variable declaration, so it's give bugs in code.
2) most of time use direct access a DOM element instead of store in variable.
3) in direct access of DOM element so access it's value like 'document.getElementById("id").value' so after need element only not
   it's value so rewrite the code and one more time access only element like this 'document.getElementById("id")'.
4) In Form validation use only " name == '' ", it means user enter multiple space so data are fill and break validation also and form submit successfully.
5) In form validation use 'innerHTML' instead of 'innterText' also don't need to use 'innerHTML'.
6) In edit functionality give a option to edit an 'ID' so change the 'ID' and click submit button so give internal error 500.
7) All task edit to only static page because use public api, but in id it's update direct in api that reason it's throw error.
